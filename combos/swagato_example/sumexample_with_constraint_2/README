apply unitarity constraint [by substituting one of variables by 1 - remaining] for sumexample 

but how do we express measurements of X+Y in such a situation?

THIS EXAMPLE IS A TOUGH ONE ... but probably a case with *only* 2 variables will not arise very often
[if it does, use previous method ala Lagrange Multipliers]
