 there are 2 measurements, one for X and one for y = 1 - x and 1 quantity => NDOF = 1 [as expected]

  f ( x0 ) = 1 - x0
  f' = -1
  f = -[f ( 0 ) - f'x x0 ]

[measurement - quantity] = [measurement - (f(0) - f'x x0 ])] - (f'x x ) 

Adjust measurement = M to A + B M , where A = -[f(0) - f'x x0 ], B = 1

  A = -[ 1 - x0 + x0 ] = -1
