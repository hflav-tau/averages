* This files describes a hypothetical simultaneous measurement 
* of two observables X and Y by a certain analysis called A3.
*
* Here, in addition to correlations between the measurements of X and Y 
* within analysis A3, the measurements of X and Y have correlations 
* with other measurements of the same observables made in analysis A2.
