*
* This files describes a hypothetical simultaneous measurement 
* of two observables X and Y by a certain analysis called A1.
* 
* Measurement of X: X = 0.51100 +-0.00495 (stat) +-0.00637 (tot syst)
* Measurement of Y: Y = 1.53400 +-0.00785 (stat) +-0.01065 (tot syst)
*
* The measurements of X and Y are sttistically correlated:
* - correlation coefficient between X and Y: rho(X,Y) = -0.26910
*
* The measurements of X and Y depend on a common parameter P1:
* - assumed central value and error for P1: P1 = 1.63500 +-0.01100
* - the central value of X decreases by 0.00068 when P1 is moved up   by 1 sigma
* - the central value of X increases by 0.00068 when P1 is moved down by 1 sigma
* - the central value of Y increases by 0.00156 when P1 is moved up   by 1 sigma
* - the central value of Y decreases by 0.00156 when P1 is moved down by 1 sigma
* - these variations are treated as a (anti-correlated) systematic uncertainty 
*   on the measurements of X and Y
*
* The measurements of X and Y have correlated systematic uncertainties, 
* specific to analysis A1:
* - a systematic uncertainty called A1_SYST1 producing a positive correlation between X and Y
* - a systematic uncertainty called A1_SYST2 producing a negative correlation between X and Y

* Now let's translate all the above in COMBOS language:

*===================
BEGIN A1 X PUBLISHED 
* The above line defines the start of the description of the X measurement in analysis A1

PARAMETERS ! assumed_value pos_excurs neg_excurs
    P1       1.63500       +0.01100   -0.01100
* The above lines give the list of parameters on which the measurement depends, 
* as well as the assumed central value and error for these parameters.

MEASUREMENT X         STAT      SYST
DATA        X         STAT      SYST
            0.51100   0.00495   0.00637
* The above lines give the central value, statistical error and total systematic error on X: 
* X = 0.51100 +-0.00495 (stat) +-0.00637 (tot syst)

STAT_CORR_WITH A1 Y PUBLISHED -0.26910
* The above line says that this measurement has a statistical correlation 
* of -0.26910 with the measurements called "A1 Y PUBLISHED", i.e. with 
* the measurement of X performed with analysis A1.

* The following lines indicate systematic errors. The quadratic sum of these 
* errors should give the total systematic error on Y quoted above.

DATA 
  P1       -0.00068 ! syst. uncertainty due to P1
  A1_SYST1 +0.00265 ! syst. uncertainty specific to analysis A1, producing a positive correlation between X and Y
  A1_SYST2 -0.00361 ! syst. uncertainty specific to analysis A1, producing a negative correlation between X and Y
  A1_SYST3 +0.00448 ! syst. uncertainty specific to analysis A1, producing no correlation between X and Y

END
* Above line indicates that the description of the measurement of X in analysis A1 is finished

*===================
BEGIN A1 Y PUBLISHED
* The above line defines the start of the description of the X measurement in analysis A1

PARAMETERS ! assumed_value pos_excurs neg_excurs
    P1    1.63500       +0.01100   -0.01100

STAT_CORR_WITH A1 X PUBLISHED -0.26910
* Statistical correlation with measurement of X in analysis A1 
* (should be the same value as the correlation given in the previous "BEGIN-END block)

* The following lines indicate systematic errors.
