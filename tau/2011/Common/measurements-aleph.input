# ALEPH measurement not used in 2010 and 2012, in order
# to use the ALEPH estimate for Gamma49 = Gamma50+Gamma51+Gamma806
# that relies on an upper limit for Gamma50, Gamma806=Gamma50, and
# a measurement for Gamma51. Since we have now measurements of Gamma50
# we can rather use the direct ALEPH measurement of Gamma51
#
# was temporarily used at end of March 2011 and then commented
# ALEPH Gamma49 pub BARATE 99R estimated as 2*Gamma50 + Gamma51 by ALEPH
# therefore 52% correlated with Gamma49 in BARATE 99R

# Gamma51 (PDG node = S035C3)
# G(pi- pi0 K(S) K(L) nu(tau)) / G(total)
